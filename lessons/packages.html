  <h2 id="packages">Packages</h2>
  <pre>
    In Go an application is organized in packages.
    A package is a collection of source files located in the same folder.
    All source files in a folder must have the same package name at the top of the file.
    By convention packages are named to be the same as the folder they are located in.
  </pre>
  <code>
    package greeting
  </code>

  <pre>
    Go provides an extensive standard library of packages which you can use in your program using the import keyword.
    Standard library packages are imported using their name.
  </pre>
  <code>
    package greeting

    import "fmt"
  </code>

  <pre>
    An imported package is then addressed with the package name:
  </pre>
  <code>
    world := "World"
    fmt.Sprintf("Hello %s", world)
  </code>

  <pre>
    Go determines if an item can be called by code in other packages through how it is declared.
    To make a function, type, variable, constant or struct field externally visible (known as exported) the name must start with a capital letter.
    This is analogous to how other programming languages like Java that use access modifiers such as public and private.
  </pre>
  <code>
    package greeting
    // Hello is a public function (callable from other packages).
    func Hello(name string) string {
        return "Hello " + name
    }

    // hello is a private function (not callable from other packages).
    func hello(name string) string {
        return "Hello " + name
    }
  </code>
</body>
