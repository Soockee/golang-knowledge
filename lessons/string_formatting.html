  <pre>
    Go provides an in-built package called fmt (format package) which offers a variety of functions to manipulate the format of input and output.
    The most commonly used function is Sprintf, which uses verbs like %s to interpolate values into a string and returns that string.
  </pre>
  <code>
    import "fmt"

    food := "taco"
    fmt.Sprintf("Bring me a %s", food)
    // Returns: Bring me a taco
  </code>
  
  <pre>
    In Go floating point values are conveniently formatted with Sprintf's verbs: %g (compact representation), %e (exponent) or %f (non exponent).
    All three verbs allow the field's width and numeric position to be controlled.
  </pre>
  <code>
    import "fmt"

    number := 4.3242
    fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", number)
    // Returns: 4.32
  </code>

  <pre>
    You can find a full list of available verbs in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/fmt">format package documentation</a>
    
    fmt contains other functions for working with strings, such as Println which simply prints the arguments it receives to the console and Printf which formats the input in the same way as Sprintf before printing it.
