  <pre>
    Like other languages, Go also provides a switch statement.
    Switch statements are a shorter way to write long if ... else if statements.
    To make a switch, we start by using the keyword switch followed by a value or expression.
    We then declare each one of the conditions with the case keyword.
    We can also declare a default case, that will run when none of the previous case conditions matched:
  </pre>

  <code>
    operatingSystem := "windows"
    switch operatingSystem {
    case "windows":
        // do something if the operating system is windows
    case "linux":
        // do something if the operating system is linux
    case "macos":
        // do something if the operating system is macos
    default:
        // do something if the operating system is none of the above
    }
  </code>

  <pre>
    One interesting thing about switch statements, is that the value after the switch keyword can be omitted, and we can have boolean conditions for each case:
  </pre>

  <code>
    age := 21
    switch {
    case age > 20 && age < 30:
        // do something if age is between 20 and 30
    case age == 10:
        // do something if age is equal to 10
    default:
        // do something else for every other case
    }
  </code>
