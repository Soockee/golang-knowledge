    A string in Go is an immutable sequence of bytes, which don't necessarily have to represent characters.
    A string literal is defined between double quotes:
  </pre>
  <code>
    const name = "Jane"
  </code>
  <pre>
    Strings can be concatenated via the + operator:
  </pre>
  <code>
    "Jane" + " " + "Austen"
    // => "Jane Austen"
  </code>
  <pre>
    Some special characters need to be escaped with a leading backslash, such as \t for a tab and \n for a new line in strings.
  </pre>
  <code>
    "How is the weather today?\nIt's sunny"  
    // =>
    // How is the weather today?
    // It's sunny
  </code>

    The strings package contains many useful functions to work on strings.
    For more information about string functions, check out the strings package documentation.
    Here are some examples:
  </pre>
  <code>
    import "strings"

    // strings.ToLower returns the string given as argument with all its characters lowercased
    strings.ToLower("MaKEmeLoweRCase")
    // => "makemelowercase"

    // strings.Repeat returns a string with a substring given as argument repeated many times
    strings.Repeat("Go", 3)
    // => "GoGoGo"
  </code>
