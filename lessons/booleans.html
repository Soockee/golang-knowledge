  <pre>
    Booleans in Go are represented by the bool type. A bool is either true or false.
    Go supports three boolean operators: ! (NOT), && (AND), and || (OR).
  </pre>
  <code>
    true || false // => true
    true && false // => false
    !true // => false
  </code>

  <pre>
    The three boolean operators each have a different operator precedence.
    As a consequence, they are evaluated in this order: 
        ! first,
        && second,
        and finally ||. 
    If you want to force a different ordering, you can enclose a boolean expression in parentheses (ie. ()), as the parentheses have an even higher operator precedence.
